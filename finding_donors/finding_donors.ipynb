    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",

    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "#### Gaussian Naive Bayes\n",
    "As we have already seen during the course, Naive Bayes classifiers work great in spam classification but I will mention another real-world application: **document classification for newspaper articles**. A few papers are published about this topic (such as [this one](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/aa96/9114cf6e4d77c5bb3dd62a20bee3446f33ab.pdf)). Even though the assumption that every word is independent from each other, they were able to classify articles with an accuracy of 77%.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strenghts of this model are:\n",
    " - It is simple to interpret. Each feature has a probability and we can simply check which ones are associated to certains classifications.\n",
    " - It is computationally fast. Training is fast and once we have all the probabilities computed, classifying new inputs is instantaneous. It is also possible to add new training data without having to use all the previous data. Probabilities can be updated incrementally.\n",
    " - It works well with high dimensions.\n",
    " \n",
    "The weaknesses of the model are:\n",
    " - It is naive, meaning that it relies on the independence assumption and it will perform badly if this assumption is not met.\n",
    " - It does not work well with small datasets.\n",
    " \n",
    "I think this could be a good model to try on this dataset since we have enough data, we have a lot of features and it is not absurd to think that a lot of these features are not dependent.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decision Trees\n",
    "Decision trees are used widely in classification problems. For example, they were used to **classify galaxies** ([Automated star/galaxy classification for digitized POSS-II](http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1995AJ....109.2401W&amp;data_type=PDF_HIGH&amp;whole_paper=YES&amp;type=PRINTER&amp;filetype=.pdf)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The strenghts of this model are:\n",
    " - It is easy to interpret and explain.\n",
    " - DTs can be displayed graphically.\n",
    " - Categorical features can be used directly (without conversioin)\n",
    " - It works well with decision boundaries parellel to the feature axis.\n",
    " \n",
    "The weaknesses of the model are:\n",
    " - Tendency to overfitting.\n",
    " - DTs can grow extremely large and complex, resulting in slow classifications.\n",
    " - When new data is added, trees must be recreated from scratch since the variables that optimally split the data could change.\n",
    " \n",
    "This model could take into account more complex relationships between features that Naive Bayes wouldn't because of the independence assumption. It is the easiest model to interpret and even though it does not get the best accuracy it can gives us some useful insights about the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### K-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "KNN models can be used in recommender systems. For example, in [this paper](http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2006/HongTsamis-KNNForNetflix.pdf) from Stanford University they use KNN to rate movies based on user similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strenghts of this model are:\n",
    " - It is an online technique (lazy learning). Like Naive bayes classifier, K-nearest Neighbors supports incremental training.\n",
    " - Can handle complex numerical functions.\n",
    " - Useful if data is difficult to collect. The scaling process can reveal which variables are unimportant for making predictions and thus can be thrown out or ignored.\n",
    " \n",
    "The weaknesses of this model are:\n",
    " - Very slow with large datasets. As it is a lazy learning, it uses all the training data points to make predictions.\n",
    " - We need to define a meaningful distance function (domain knowledge).\n",
    " - We have to keep all training data. Unlike the two previous models where once we have finished the training we don't need that date anymore, in this case we have to store all the data.\n",
    " \n",
    "I think this model could work well with our dataset because I can imagine that both classes overlap in the features space. Although SVMs may also be a good choice, I choose KNN because I haven't use it in scikit-learn before."

Decision Tree model was clearly overfitted because it got an F-score $\\sim$ 1 in the training subset when using all the data while in the testing subset it got around 0.6. Nevertheless, both accuracy score and F-score are quite similar to the ones obtained with KNN when using all the available data.\n",

    "We will be using a Decision Trees to classify the data into two categories:\n",
    " 1. People with incomes over 50K.\n",
    " 2. People with incomes under 50K.\n",
    " \n",
    "Decision Trees use very simple 'if-then' conditions to split data into different leaves. For example, a condition could be $\\text{hours-per-week} >35$. All data entries would go either to the leave where hours-per-week is equal or bigger than 35 or to the leave where it is less than 35. Using a lot of these conditions based on data features, and one after another like a tree, we can successfully classify data in this two categories. Features and conditions are chosen cleverly by the algorithm based on how they manage to increase the class purity in the nodes after each split.\n",
    "\n",
    "DTs are also easy to interpret, they are not black boxes. Splits are computed during the training phase and the list of variables and conditions used will give a lot of useful insights without even predict anything. Besides, predictions are really fast since training data will not be used anymore. We will be able to predict thousands of potential donors in few seconds."

Altough I put `education` in my list, here it appears `education-num` as the fifth most important feature. What really surprises me is that `occupation` is not in this top five features. It looks like the age and the amount of hours at work is more relevant that the occupation to classify incomes. Third most important feature is `capital-gain` followed by `marital-status`, which I don't understand why appears in this list. `capital-gain` makes sense and after this I would have added to my list instead of `native-country`."

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn.

    "\n",
    "Good analysis. Note feature selection process is key in Machine Learning problems, the idea behind it is that you want to have the minimum number of features than capture trends and patterns in your data. A good feature set contains features that are highly correlated with the class, yet uncorrelated with each other. Your machine learning algorithm is just going to be as good as the features you put into it. For that reason, this is definitely a critical step into any ML problem. In this case, there are not significant differences in terms of performance, but in terms of computational costs and interpretability, there is a significant gain!"

    "Accuracy on testing subset is almost the same when using all the data or the reduced one, but F-score gets a little bit worse. It declines about a 5% from 0.7315 to 0.6942.\n",
    "\n",
    "If training time were a factor I would consider using the reduced data. It is clear that there is a tradeoff between performance and reducing features. If we have a huge training dataset and it takes too much time, we could benefit from using the reduced data even though the performance of our model gets worse. We should decide where to draw the line, where reducing number of features stops being reasonable. Moreover, if we use the reduced data we could tune the parameters using a bigger grid, and perpahs this tunning compensate the lost features."
